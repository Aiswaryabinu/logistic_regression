# Logistic Regression

This repository contains code and resources related to implementing and understanding Logistic Regression, a popular statistical method used for binary classification in machine learning.

## Overview

Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict the probability of a categorical dependent variable. In this repository, you'll find:

- Python implementation(s) of Logistic Regression
- Example datasets
- Usage instructions
- Explanations and references

## Features

- Train a Logistic Regression model on sample data
- Visualize training results and decision boundaries
- Evaluate model accuracy and performance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or above is recommended). You may also need the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Usage

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aiswaryabinu/logistic_regression.git
cd logistic_regression
```

Run the main script (replace `main.py` with the actual script name if different):

```bash
python main.py
```

## Repository Structure

├── utils.py            # Helper functions (if any)
└── README.md           # This file
```

## Example

Given a dataset, the code will:

1. Load and preprocess the data
2. Train a Logistic Regression model
3. Output accuracy and other evaluation metrics
4. Visualize results (optional)
